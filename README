# IKR project #
Classification system person recognition, based on the training data. It consists of three parts:
* system for voice recognition
* system for face recognition
* fusion, that puts the outputs together, and makes the hard decision

## Usage ##
$ ./main [--train]

If the optional argument --train is given, the classifiers look for the training data
in directories ./data/target_train, ./data/non_target_train.
If the parameter is missing, it looks for train/ directory and the trained values,
saved in covs1.npy, mus1.npy, ws1.npy, covs2.npy, mus2.npy, ws2.npy.
